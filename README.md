# COMP551_ImageClassification
We use .gitignore to ignore all the huge data files.
Please makesure all the 3 files test_max_x train_max_x train_may_y.csv are all locally stored in your pycharm folder (COMP551_ImageCLassification)

Hi, there is a new file clean_Data. After you run it you should get a new dataset without backgrounds. 
I would like to ask you to still build your models with the normal Dataset. We will try the cleaned one afterwards. 
Sometimes it does weird things, but in this case I really think it helps.
